## Foreign Business Act Legal Framework

**Foreign Business Act provisions are Thailand's primary regulatory framework** for foreign participation in designated business sectors, protecting national economic interests whilst enabling controlled foreign investment under specific conditions.

### What is the legislative purpose and scope?

**The Foreign Business Act establishes protective mechanisms** for Thai economic sovereignty through comprehensive business activity restrictions and licensing requirements. **Legislative intent balances foreign investment benefits** against national interest protection,n creating structured regulatory frameworks and compliance requirements.

**Regulatory scope encompasses diverse business sectors,** including property development, real estate services, and other land-related activities, creating extensive foreign participation constraints. **Professional advice requires understanding to ensure client compliance** whilst identifying permissible investment structures and appropriate legal frameworks.

**Coordination with other legislation,** including Land Code provisions and the Anti-Money Laundering Act, creates a comprehensive regulatory environment requiring integrated compliance approaches and adoption of professional expertise.

### How does the Act integrate with property law?

**Foreign Business Act restrictions complement Land Code provisions,** creating layered constraints on foreign property participation through business activity limitations and ownership prohibitions. **Combined effect prevents legitimising nominee structures** through dual regulatory enforcement and imposition of criminal liability provisions.

**Real estate activities,** including development, brokerage, and management services, face specific restrictions leading to business operation constraints for foreign participants. **Property investment structures must navigate** both the Foreign Business Act and Land Code requirements to ensure comprehensive regulatory compliance.

**Legal coordination requirements** affect implementation of fit-for-purpose solutions necessitating professional expertise to ensure appropriate legal frameworks and compliance obligations are met throughout the lifecycle of any investment..

## Foreign Definition and Scope

**The Foreign Business Act establishes broad definitions** encompassing natural persons, juristic entities, and a diverse array of ownership structures, creating extensive regulatory risks affecting property investment, with penalties for non-compliance.

### How are foreigners defined under the Act?

**Classification of natural persons** includes individuals without Thai nationality. **Juristic person categorisation** encompasses entities not registered in Thailand or Thai registered companies with majority foreign ownership or disguised control and/or economic benefits, creating corporate structuring restrictions and responsibilities.

**Ownership thresholds** equal to or above 50% capital share or investment benefits and levels triggering foreign classification risk are designated a nominee structure and subject to detection mechanisms. **Voting rights assessment** includes control evaluation beyond shareholding to examine decision-making authority, source of funding and operational management.

**Broad definition scope** prevents circumvention through complex avoidance structures,s ensuring regulatory effectiveness whilst creating compliance challenges requiring professional advice on navigation.

### What ownership structures trigger Foreign Business Act restrictions?

**The majority foreign shareholding** in Thai companies denotes foreign classification requiring Foreign Business Act compliance and/or approved licensing. **Foreign capital contribution** exceeding 50% total capital investment triggers regulatory constraints regardless of shareholding distribution, opening up funding source scrutiny.

**Voting control mechanisms** through shareholder agreements, share classes and/or operational management denote foreign classification even with minority shareholding percentages. **Nominee structure indicators,** including Thai shareholders without genuine financial capacity, create enforcement triggers under current regulatory scrutiny.

**Professional analysis** can determine likely structure classification, ensuring appropriate regulatory compliance is met whilst identifying potential violation risks requiring protective action.

## Prohibited Business Categories

**The Foreign Business Act establishes three restriction categories,** creating varying prohibition levels and licensing requirements affecting foreign participation possibilities.

### Which List One activities are absolutely prohibited?

**Land trading activities** remain absolutely prohibited to foreigners, preventing property speculation and ownership circumvention, creating fundamental market and commercial constraints. **Property development for sale** faces a complete foreign participation prohibition affecting development project structures and end-ownership arrangements.

**Real estate brokerage services** for land and buildings remain prohibited, creating service delivery constraints requiring Thai entity engagement. **Agricultural activities,** including farming and forestry, face prohibition affecting rural property investment and development opportunities.

**No licensing pathway exists** for List One activities, creating an absolute foreign participation prohibition requiring the need for compliant alternative structures, such as Better-than-Freehold™, to achieve property investment objectives.

### Which List Two and Three restrictions affect property activities?

**List two activities,** including certain real estate services that require ministerial approval and Council of Ministers authorisation and the need to pass exceptional licensing procedures. **Service businesses** providing property-related advisory or management services might face restrictions requiring licensing assessment and professional coordination.

**List three property management** and related services that require Director-General approval through the Foreign Business Committee evaluation. **Capital requirements** and economic benefit demonstrations can lead to licensing preconditions; one the least,  approval remains very rare for property-related activities.

**Practical licensing limitations** make Foreign Business Act permissions unfeasible from a risk perspective for most foreign property investors who require certainty, security and alternative legally compliant solutions such as Better-than-Freehold™.

## Property Investment Implications

**Foreign Business Act restrictions fundamentally shape** property investment vehicles, requiring fit-for-purpose legal architecture and compliant alternatives such as Better-than-Freehold™ to avoid prohibited activities.

### How do restrictions affect property ownership structures?

**Direct land ownership prohibition** under Land Code legislation, combined with Foreign Business Act restrictions on property business activities, leads to dual regulatory constraints. **Nominee company structures that** violate Foreign Business Act provisions through hidden foreign control or circumventing ownership restrictions are open to civil and criminal liabilities.

**Property development activities** for sale purposes remain prohibited, requiring Thai entity engagement or alternative solutions that meet the substance and letter of the law, such as Better-than-Freehold™. **Investment vehicles** must adhere to Foreign Business Act rules alongside Land Code legislation, both of which are increasingly complex legal constructs.

### Which property-related activities face restrictions?

**Real estate brokerage** and property sales activities remain prohibited to foreign participants and require Thai service provider engagement. **Property management services** might face enhanced licensing requirements depending on the activity scope and business structure characteristics.

**Construction activities** for property development purposes may trigger Foreign Business Act breaches, requiring care to ensure adherence with business practice classification and compliance verification. **Professional services** relating to property transactions require detailed analysis to ensure Foreign Business Act compliance throughout business operations.

**Activity categorisation** affects compliance requirements, which can be derisked through undertaking professional legal assessment and advice regards appropriate structure implementation, such as Better-than-Freehold™.

## Enforcement and Penalties

**Foreign Business Act violations** open up criminal liability exposure and operational constraints requiring immediate attention and proactive risk mitigation actions.

### What penalties apply for Foreign Business Act violations?

**Criminal sanctions** include imprisonment up to three years for Foreign Business Act violations, creating personal liability for directors and beneficial owners. **Financial penalties** can reach 100,000 baht per violation, whilst continuing offences create cumulative liability exposure.

**Combined AMLA 2025 liability** classifies Foreign Business Act violations as predicate offences coupled with money laundering charges and enhanced penalties reaching 10 years imprisonment.

### How has enforcement evolved in the current regulatory environment?

**The Department of Business Development (DBD)** conducts systematic and wide-ranging company investigations to identify foreign control indicators and nominee abuses. **Multi-agency coordination,** including the Anti Money Laundering Office ( and the Department of Special Investigations (DSI) AMLO and DSI creates a comprehensive enforcement capability through database integration and information sharing.

**Technology-enhanced detection** through AI-driven surveillance tools is designed to identify ownership patterns and foreign control breaches, enabling proactive enforcement actions. **Increased prosecution activity** demonstrates the government's commitment to Foreign Business Act enforcement, demonstrating the need for immediate action regarding compliance protections and monitoring.
