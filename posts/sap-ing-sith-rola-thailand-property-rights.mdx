<KeyTakeaways>

- **Sap Ing Sith (ROLA)** is a 30-year registrable right with no statutory renewal guarantee — not the quasi-ownership agents are selling you.
- **Buildings revert to the landowner** at termination under Section 11 of the Act, meaning your multi-million baht villa might become someone else's property.
- **Marketing claims of 60- or 90-year terms** are legally baseless — the Sap-Ing-Sith Act B.E. 2562 (2019) contains no renewal mechanism whatsoever.
- **Better-than-Freehold™** delivers what Sap Ing Sith promises but cannot provide: rolling renewal, building protection, registered security, and offshore financing up to **50% LTV**.

</KeyTakeaways>

<QuickAnswer>

**Quick Answer**: Sap Ing Sith grants the holder the right to use and benefit from immovable property for up to **30 years**. The right is transferable, inheritable, and mortgageable. It is *not* ownership. It carries no guaranteed renewal. And unless you negotiate carefully, every building you construct becomes the landowner's asset when the clock runs out.

## What Is Sap Ing Sith and Why Are Agents Pushing It?

**Sap Ing Sith** (ทรัพย์อิงสิทธิ), frequently marketed in English as a "Right over Leased Asset" or **ROLA**, is a registrable property right introduced under the **Sap-Ing-Sith Act B.E. 2562 (2019)**. It came into force on **27 October 2019** and applies exclusively to **Chanote-titled land**, buildings on Chanote land, and registered condominium units.

## Sap Ing Sith vs Leasehold vs Better-than-Freehold™

| **Factor** | **Standard Lease** | **Sap Ing Sith (ROLA)** | **Better-than-Freehold™** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Maximum Term** | 30 years | 30 years | Rolling 30-year terms |
| **Renewal Guarantee** | None — new agreement needed | None — Act is silent on renewal | Enforceable option contract |
| **Transferable** | Only with lessor consent | Yes (registered) | Yes — beneficial interest |
| **Inheritable** | Limited | Yes | Yes — through trust structure |
| **Mortgageable** | No | Yes | Yes — offshore, up to **50% LTV** |
| **Building Ownership at Expiry** | Per contract terms | Reverts to landowner (Section 11) | Protected through trust/CBSA |
| **Registration Cost** | 1–1.1% of total rental | ~20,000 THB flat fee | Structured professional fees |
| **AMLA Compliance** | Depends on structure | Neutral — no compliance risk | Full compliance by design |
| **Revendication Rights** | No | No — notify owner only | Protected via CBSA enforcement |

## The Problem: What Agents Are Actually Selling You

Here is what is happening across Phuket, Koh Samui, and every other property hotspot in Thailand right now. Agents are presenting **Sap Ing Sith** as the breakthrough foreign buyers have been waiting for. The pitch sounds compelling: "It's like ownership. Your name goes on a separate title deed. You can sell it, mortgage it, pass it to your heirs. It's better than a lease."

Every single one of those statements is technically accurate. And every single one is missing the part that matters.

### What Does the Act Actually Say?

The **Sap-Ing-Sith Act** is a mere 17 sections long. It creates a registrable real right — meaning it binds the property itself, surviving changes of land ownership. The holder receives a **Sap Ing Sith certificate** (featuring the blue Garuda) that functions as a separate title document. Under **Section 11**, the holder exercises the same rights, duties, and liabilities as if they were the owner.

That sounds extraordinary. Until you read the rest of Section 11.

### What Section 11 Takes Away

**Revendication rights** — the legal power to reclaim your property from someone who has taken unlawful possession — remain with the landowner. Not you. If someone occupies your villa, you cannot take legal action directly. You notify the landowner and hope they act. The same applies to preventing unlawful interference with the property.

This is not a minor technicality. This is the difference between controlling your own asset and depending on someone else to protect it.

## Five Structural Weaknesses Agents Will Not Mention

### Does Sap Ing Sith Guarantee Renewal?

No. The Act contains **zero provisions for renewal**. After 30 years, the right terminates automatically. Full stop. Continuing your occupation requires negotiating an entirely new agreement with the landowner — who has absolutely no legal obligation to agree, and every commercial incentive to renegotiate from a position of strength.

### What Happens to Your Buildings?

Under **Section 11**, any buildings or structures the holder constructs, modifies, or expands on the property **become the landowner's property when the right terminates**, unless you have negotiated a different agreement. Think about that. You spend **10, 15, 20 million baht** building a villa. Thirty years later, it belongs to someone else. The Act provides **no statutory compensation** for improvements.

### Why Can't You Protect Yourself Directly?

The holder lacks both **revendication rights** and the right to prevent unlawful interference. Academic analysis from Thammasat University has questioned whether Sap Ing Sith genuinely functions as a real right when the holder cannot independently enforce possession against third parties.

### Are Land Offices Ready for Sap Ing Sith?

Practitioners report persistent difficulties with provincial **Land Office** registration. The right has existed since 2019, yet many offices remain unfamiliar with the process. One Thai law firm documented needing to contact Bangkok authorities directly to instruct local officials on how to issue the certificate. If the bureaucracy cannot register your right smoothly, enforcing it becomes even more uncertain.

### Is Sap Ing Sith Actually Financeable?

On paper, yes — the Act permits **mortgage of the right**. In practice, Thai banks rarely lend against Sap Ing Sith. The right is too new, the precedent too thin, and the 30-year terminal date creates obvious collateral risk. Foreign buyers hoping to leverage their investment will find the financing door largely closed.

---

## The Renewal Myth: 60 Years of Fantasy

Some agents are now marketing Sap Ing Sith with **"30+30"** or even **"30+30+30"** terms. This deserves addressing directly: it is legally baseless.

The **Supreme Court Judgment No. 4655/2566** confirmed — in the context of leasehold — that pre-agreed renewal clauses attempting to circumvent the 30-year statutory cap are void and unenforceable. Legal commentators and academic researchers agree this reasoning applies with equal force to Sap Ing Sith. The Department of Lands' own regulation **DOL.0609.3/ว131 (2563)** addresses only new registration after expiration, not renewal.

A promise to renew, made today, creates nothing more than a **personal contractual obligation** — unenforceable against third parties and worthless if the landowner sells the property, dies, or simply changes their mind in three decades.

Anyone marketing a 60- or 90-year Sap Ing Sith is either uninformed or deliberately misleading you. Either way, your investment is at risk.

## Better-than-Freehold™ Solution

Every weakness in Sap Ing Sith exists because the right depends on a single 30-year window with no structural mechanism for what happens next. **Better-than-Freehold™** was designed from the ground up to eliminate precisely these vulnerabilities.

### How Does Better-than-Freehold™ Address the Renewal Problem?

**Better-than-Freehold™** structures do not rely on promises to renew. The mechanism is fundamentally different: a **registered 30-year lease** combined with an **option contract** — held by **Siam Property Holdings** as trustee — enabling the investor to sell the freehold for profit, re-lease for a further 30-year term, or renew the option for multiple further terms. This is not a pre-agreed renewal clause. It is a genuine commercial option, independently enforceable.

### How Are Buildings Protected?

**Clear Blue Security Agents** registers all contracts with Thai authorities and holds **registered security** over all invested assets. The trust framework ensures building ownership is protected through the **CBSA enforcement mechanism** — not dependent on landowner goodwill at the 30-year mark.

### Is Better-than-Freehold™ Actually Financeable?

Yes. **Siam Venture Capital** provides offshore financing up to **50% loan-to-value** secured by trust assets. This is not theoretical — it is operational infrastructure delivering real lending to real investors. Sap Ing Sith cannot match this because Thai banks will not lend against it and the structure provides no offshore financing pathway.

### What About AMLA Compliance?

**Better-than-Freehold™** ensures full compliance with the **Anti-Money Laundering Act**, the **Foreign Business Act**, the **Land Code**, and Thai Revenue Department requirements. All leases, options, mortgages, and pledges are registered publicly at the Land Office and the Department of Business Development. Legal opinions from **Nishimura & Asahi** support the validity of every component.

Sap Ing Sith itself is not an AMLA risk — but it does nothing to address the broader compliance landscape that any serious foreign property investment must navigate.

## FAQ Section

<FAQAccordion faqs={[
  {
    question: "What is Sap Ing Sith in Thailand?",
    answer: "Sap Ing Sith (ทรัพย์อิงสิทธิ) is a registrable real right created under the Sap-Ing-Sith Act B.E. 2562 (2019), granting the holder the right to use and benefit from Chanote-titled immovable property for up to 30 years. The right is transferable, inheritable, and mortgageable, but carries no statutory renewal guarantee and buildings revert to the landowner at termination."
  },
  {
    question: "Can Sap Ing Sith be renewed after 30 years?",
    answer: "No renewal provision exists in the Act. The right expires automatically. Any continuation requires negotiating an entirely new agreement with the landowner. Claims of 60-year or 90-year terms are legally inaccurate, consistent with Supreme Court precedent voiding pre-agreed renewal clauses."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Sap Ing Sith better than a lease for foreigners?",
    answer: "Sap Ing Sith offers specific advantages — transferability, inheritability, and mortgageability — but shares the same 30-year cap and introduces building reversion risk. Better-than-Freehold™ addresses every limitation through rolling renewal options and registered security interests."
  },
  {
    question: "Can foreigners register Sap Ing Sith in Thailand?",
    answer: "Yes, foreigners can hold Sap Ing Sith rights. However, many provincial Land Offices remain unfamiliar with the registration process, creating practical delays and administrative complications that might affect your timeline."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to buildings when Sap Ing Sith expires?",
    answer: "Buildings revert to the landowner under Section 11 unless otherwise agreed. No statutory compensation exists for improvements. A foreign investor might lose a multi-million baht villa without any legal remedy."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does Sap Ing Sith registration cost?",
    answer: "Registration fees are approximately 20,000 THB — lower than leasehold registration at 1–1.1% of total rental value. However, the lower cost does not offset the structural weaknesses, particularly the absence of renewal guarantees and building protection."
  },
  {
    question: "What is Better-than-Freehold™ and how does it compare to Sap Ing Sith?",
    answer: "Better-than-Freehold™ is a fully compliant ownership structure providing rolling 30-year leases with enforceable renewal options, registered security interests through Clear Blue Security Agents, asset protection via independent trustees, and offshore financing up to 50% LTV. It delivers lifetime security without relying on landowner cooperation."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Sap Ing Sith a real right or personal right?",
    answer: "Sap Ing Sith is classified as a registrable real right, but academic analysis questions this classification because the holder lacks revendication rights and cannot prevent unlawful interference independently — rights that typically define genuine real property interests under Thai law."

## Expert Recommendations

**Thai property rights for foreigners** require navigating overlapping legal frameworks — and the gap between marketing claims and legal reality has never been wider than with Sap Ing Sith.

### Professional Guidance Essential

If you are being offered a Sap Ing Sith structure, demand written answers to three questions before signing anything: What specifically happens to buildings you construct at the 30-year mark? What enforceable mechanism guarantees renewal? And what financing is actually available — not theoretically, but from a named lender with stated terms?

### Immediate Action Required

If you are already holding a Sap Ing Sith right, assess your position now — not in year 25 when your negotiating leverage has evaporated. The earlier you evaluate alternative structures, the more options you retain.

### Long-term Security Strategy

**Better-than-Freehold™** exists because every other structure available to foreigners in Thailand — leasehold, usufruct, superficies, and now Sap Ing Sith — ultimately fails the same test: what happens after 30 years? The answer, for all of them, is "you hope for the best." That is not a security strategy. That is a gamble.

## Conclusion

**Sap Ing Sith is not what agents are telling you it is.** It is a legitimate legal instrument with genuine advantages over a standard lease — transferability, inheritability, and mortgageability are real improvements. But it remains a 30-year wasting asset with no renewal guarantee, no building protection at expiry, and no practical financing pathway.

**The marketing around ROLA is running dangerously ahead of the legal reality.** Claims of 60-year terms, quasi-ownership status, and mortgage availability from Thai banks are either uninformed or deliberately misleading. Foreign buyers committing millions of baht to Thai property deserve better than a structure that leaves them negotiating from weakness in three decades.

**Better-than-Freehold™** delivers the compliance, security, and financing that Sap Ing Sith promises but structurally cannot provide. Rolling 30-year leases with enforceable options, registered security through **Clear Blue Security Agents**, and offshore financing up to **50% LTV** through **Siam Venture Capital** — this is what genuine long-term property security looks like.

Stop accepting 30-year dead ends dressed up as breakthroughs. Demand a structure that works for your lifetime, not just the next three decades.
