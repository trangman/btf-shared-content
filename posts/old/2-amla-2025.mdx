## Cabinet-Approved Changes

### Expanded Criminal Classifications

The amendments broaden money laundering predicate offences:

**New Criminal Categories:**

- **Acting as a nominee for foreign nationals,** circumventing the Foreign Business Act restrictions  
- Tax evasion within criminal networks under the Revenue Code provisions  
- Terrorism financing and weapons proliferation activities  
- Digital asset fraud involving cryptocurrency and futures trading  
- Government contract collusion and bidding manipulation  
- Bribery of domestic and foreign public officials

### Technology-Enhanced Detection

**Advanced Surveillance Capabilities:**

- Pattern recognition algorithms identifying circular ownership structures  
- Cross-bank financial flow analysis reveals suspicious funding sources  
- Automated property transaction monitoring flagging below-market transfers  
- Corporate relationship mapping exposes hidden connections between entities

### Beneficial Ownership Transparency

**Enhanced Requirements:**

- Financial institutions must report beneficial ownership information to AMLO  
- Beneficial owners face mandatory self-disclosure obligations with limited exceptions  
- Enhanced due diligence requirements across all covered entities  
- Expanded coverage to digital assets and fintech service providers

### Asset Recovery Powers

**Strengthened Enforcement:**

- Administrative asset seizure without court orders for suspected violations  
- Expanded recovery authority from facilitators and supporters of violations  
- Whistleblower programmes offering up to 10% of seized assets  
- Criminal prosecution for professional facilitators, including lawyers and accountants

## Better-than-Freehold™ Solution

Better-than-Freehold™ eliminates all nominee vulnerabilities through sophisticated architecture, ensuring compliance under current enforcement whilst preparing for enhanced requirements.

### Complete Compliance Framework

**Nominee Risk Elimination:** Thailand Investor Network operates as a genuinely independent Thai entity without foreign funding or control. This structure exceeds Foreign Business Act requirements whilst avoiding all nominee indicators identified by current enforcement patterns.

**Technology Compatibility:** Structure accommodates AI surveillance and automated monitoring through transparent documentation and registered contracts. All relationships operate within clear legal boundaries without concealment.

**Professional Safety:** Structure eliminates gatekeeper liability exposure for facilitating advisors. All parties operate within established legal frameworks, avoiding criminal prosecution risk.

### Security Through Legal Architecture

**Asset Protection:** Registered security interests prevent administrative seizure under enhanced enforcement powers. CBSA enforcement provides streamlined remedies without court dependency through professional monitoring.

**Financing Access:** Offshore financing up to 50% LTV through regulated credit structures enables leverage unavailable through traditional methods. Trust assets provide recognised collateral for international lenders.

**Succession Planning:** Beneficial interests transfer through offshore mechanisms without Thai probate requirements. Inheritance planning operates independently of local property law restrictions.

### Investment Advantages

**Tax Efficiency:** Offshore ownership structure minimises Thai land transfer tax on resale whilst maintaining Revenue Code compliance. Capital gains taxation occurs only upon Thailand remittance.

**Market Liquidity:** Resale through beneficial interest assignment provides faster settlement than traditional property transfers. Transaction completion occurs within days rather than months through CBSA enforcement.

## Implementation Timeline

### Current Enforcement (2025)

Aggressive prosecution operates with 29,000+ active cases, which is just the start, demonstrating immediate risk. Multi-agency coordination enables real-time investigation and asset seizure. Technology-enhanced detection systems identify suspicious patterns, creating unprecedented enforcement capability.

### Amendment Implementation (2026-2027)

Parliamentary approval creates expanded predicate offences and enhanced penalties for violations. Technology integration mandates digital reporting systems across financial institutions. Professional obligations increase through enhanced gatekeeper requirements targeting facilitators.

The timeline demonstrates immediate compliance necessity rather than delayed preparation strategies.

## Common Pitfalls

### Continued Nominee Reliance

Many investors mistakenly believe they can maintain nominee structures until formal amendment passage. Current enforcement cases demonstrate the risk of immediate prosecution under existing predicate offence definitions.

### Professional Malaise

The majority of providers are underestimating current gatekeeper liability and are open to substantial risk exposure. Current enforcement already targets facilitating professionals with criminal prosecution and professional sanctions.

### Timing Misconceptions

**Critical Errors Include:**

- Advisors are suggesting delayed compliance until Parliamentary approval  
- Promoting structures involving Thai shareholders with foreign funding sources  
- Advising on arrangements that maintain disguised foreign control mechanisms  
- Professional advice that ignores or minimises enforcement reality and prosecution patterns
