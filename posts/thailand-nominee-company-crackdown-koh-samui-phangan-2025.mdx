## Investigation Scope and Scale

### Nationwide Monitoring Intensifies

The Department of Business Development revised its inspection framework focusing on businesses where foreigners hold between 0.001% and 49.99% of shares across six high-risk sectors, involving 46,918 entities nationwide[^1]. This enhanced scrutiny applies deeper criteria beyond simple shareholder ratios, identifying genuine risk indicators through advanced analysis.

After initial screening, approximately 1,000 businesses receive priority for immediate investigation, with probes subsequently extending to entities presenting lower risk levels[^1]. The monitoring covers nationwide operations, not solely Surat Thani province, following increasing reports of foreigners acquiring land and operating businesses in popular tourist destinations.

### Foreign Investment Patterns

**European and international investors** dominate the suspected nominee arrangements, operating enterprises ranging from large-scale developments to small businesses using Thai nationals as proxy shareholders[^1]. Travel and Tour World reported the situation reveals significant concerns within real estate, tourism, and hospitality sectors where foreign direct investments concentrate[^3].

## Enforcement Actions and Arrests

### Recent Raid Results

Police conducted coordinated raids across four locations on Koh Phangan, seizing evidence linked to 89 companies suspected of using nominee structures to conceal land sales and evade over 152 million baht in taxes[^2]. Authorities summoned foreign tourists for questioning after discovering illegal luxury villas operating without proper authorization.

Between October 2024 and September 2025, Surat Thani Provincial Police recorded 2,001 foreign-related offenses, including 18 nominee cases distributed across Koh Phangan Police (eight cases), Bo Phut Police (eight cases), and Koh Samui Police (two cases)[^4]. The 18 investigations involve real estate and hotel operations (10 cases), construction firms (2), computer services (2), plus single cases for car rental, café, visa services, and cleaning companies[^4].

### Criminal Prosecutions

Multiple foreign nationals faced arrest during enforcement operations. Police detained three Israeli nationals and five Thai and Myanmar workers targeting two hotels operating without licenses and employing illegal migrant workers[^5]. Authorities charged company directors with operating hotels without authorization whilst pursuing additional suspects for prosecution.

Investigations extend beyond foreign operators, targeting Thai nationals who facilitated ownership concealment and government officials involved in violations[^4]. This comprehensive approach ensures accountability throughout nominee structure chains.

## Two-Stage Prosecution Strategy

### Immediate Action Phase

**Police investigation and intelligence divisions** combined data analysis guiding enforcement actions through two distinct stages. The immediate action phase targets foreigners working without permits, engaging in occupations reserved for Thais, or overstaying visas, with on-the-spot arrests and prosecution[^4].

### Evidence-Based Investigations

The second phase involves comprehensive investigations of corporate structures, land ownership records, tax payment histories, hotel operations, and construction activities, with cases referred to relevant authorities for formal complaints[^4]. Pol. Maj. Gen. Saranyu Chamnanrach, deputy commissioner of Provincial Police Region 8, confirmed this integrated approach marks the beginning of broader crackdowns across Region 8, including Phuket, Krabi, Phang Nga, and Surat Thani[^4].

### Institutional Framework Enhancement

Following recent government changes, the Commerce Ministry proposed appointing a new committee chaired by a deputy prime minister, expanding membership to four key agencies: the Department of Special Investigation (DSI), Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO), Board of Investment (BOI), and Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT)[^1]. This coordination strengthens enforcement capacity whilst ensuring consistent application of AMLA 2025 compliance standards.

## Better-than-Freehold Solution

**Better-than-Freehold** eliminates nominee structure risks through compliant legal frameworks enabling foreign property ownership whilst ensuring complete protection under Thai law and AMLA 2025 regulations.

### Compliant Structure Components

**Thailand Investor Network** operates as the transparent foreign holding entity, bypassing nominee requirements through registered corporate structures complying with Foreign Business Act parameters. **Siam Property Holdings** functions as the Thai trustee company maintaining legal ownership whilst securing beneficial ownership through enforceable trust deeds and registered security interests.

**Clear Blue Security Agents** provide independent enforcement mechanisms protecting foreign investor rights through mortgage registrations at district land offices, creating legally enforceable claims against property assets.

### Security Mechanisms

**Registered security interests** ensure foreign investors maintain enforceable rights through official land office registrations, creating legal protection independent of trustee cooperation. These security registrations survive company changes, ownership transfers, and legal challenges, providing comprehensive asset protection.

**Professional trust management** eliminates the personal relationship dependencies characterizing nominee arrangements, substituting professional obligations with legally enforceable contractual mechanisms and independent security agent oversight.

### Investment Advantages

**Offshore financing** up to 50% loan-to-value enables international banks to provide secured lending against Better-than-Freehold structures, accessing capital markets unavailable to nominee arrangements. **Tax efficiency** through proper corporate structuring ensures legitimate tax optimization whilst maintaining complete AMLA 2025 compliance.

**Inheritance planning** operates through standard corporate mechanisms and trust deed provisions, enabling straightforward wealth transfer without Thai probate complications or nominee structure exposure.
