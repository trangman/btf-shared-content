faqs:
  - question: "What is DBD Order 2/2568?"
    answer: "DBD Order 2/2568 is a regulatory instruction issued on 1 December 2025 and effective from 1 January 2026, introducing stricter evidentiary requirements for company registrations involving foreign shareholders or foreign authorised directors. It replaces the previous 2012 framework (Order 205/2555) and requires Thai shareholders to provide three months of bank statements demonstrating genuine financial capacity."
  - question: "What documents must Thai shareholders provide under Order 2/2568?"
    answer: "Thai shareholders must submit three months of personal bank statements from the account used for share payment. The statements must show a withdrawal or transfer matching the exact amount and date of the share subscription payment, demonstrating that investment capital is genuinely theirs."
  - question: "When does DBD Order 2/2568 apply?"
    answer: "The order applies at the incorporation stage in two scenarios: where foreigners collectively hold less than 50% of shares (the standard 49:51 structure), and where a foreigner holds an authorised director or signatory authority, even where no foreign equity exists."
  - question: "Does Order 2/2568 affect existing companies?"
    answer: "The order applies specifically to new company registrations. However, existing companies face separate enforcement through the DBD Biz Regist platform, AI-driven screening, and inter-agency investigations currently targeting 46,918 entities nationally."
  - question: "Why does Order 2/2568 target companies with foreign directors but no foreign shareholders?"
    answer: "The expansion reflects the DBD's broadened interpretation of 'effective control.' Some nominee structures avoid foreign shareholding entirely whilst placing foreigners in director or signatory roles to maintain operational control. The order now captures these structures by triggering disclosure requirements whenever a foreigner holds binding authority."
  - question: "What is the 3-month bank statement requirement designed to detect?"
    answer: "The requirement targets temporary capital staging, where funds are deposited briefly into a nominee's account to satisfy registration requirements before being withdrawn. Three months of transaction history verify that capital is 'seasoned' and belongs to the shareholder rather than representing a pass-through transaction."
  - question: "How does Order 2/2568 relate to AMLA enforcement?"
    answer: "The order strengthens the registration gateway feeding into broader AMLA enforcement. Companies flagged at registration through inconsistent funding patterns become targets for inter-agency investigation. With nominee structures classified as predicate offences under AMLA, registration-stage detection creates immediate criminal exposure."
  - question: "How does Better-than-Freehold™ avoid the constraints created by Order 2/2568?"
    answer: "Better-than-Freehold™ eliminates nominee company dependency entirely. The structure operates through a genuinely independent Thai entity with no foreign funding or control, a regulated Labuan trust, and registered security interests, requiring no Thai shareholder structures that might trigger DBD scrutiny."

## What Triggered This Regulatory Change

**Thailand's enforcement authorities have been systematically tightening corporate registration requirements** as part of the nationwide campaign against nominee structures. The previous 2012 framework (Order 205/2555) required only basic bank-issued financial certificates, documents that were straightforward to obtain and provided minimal verification of genuine capital contribution.

### Why did the old framework prove inadequate?

**The 2012 requirements created a compliance gap** that nominee facilitators and abusers exploited routinely. A Thai national acting as a nominee shareholder could present a simple bank balance certificate showing sufficient funds on a single date, without demonstrating any genuine history of capital accumulation or a legitimate source of investment funds. Temporary deposits, arranged and withdrawn within days of registration, satisfied the technical requirements whilst facilitating illegal nominee ownership.

**DBD enforcement data now confirms the scale of this problem.** With **46,918 entities** nationally identified for enhanced screening and **29,000+ legal cases** initiated for nominee violations, the registration gateway required fundamental strengthening. Order 2/2568 is the regulatory response, transforming the incorporation process from a procedural formality into a genuine verification checkpoint.

## When Does Order 2/2568 Apply

**The order creates two distinct trigger scenarios** at the company incorporation stage, both requiring Thai shareholders to substantiate their investment funds with documentary evidence.

### What are the two trigger scenarios?

**Scenario one: minority foreign shareholding.** Any partnership or limited company where foreigners collectively hold less than 50% of registered capital, encompassing the standard **49:51 ownership structure** that has historically been the foundation of nominee company formations across Thailand's property sector.

**Scenario two: foreign authorised directors.** Any limited company with no foreign shareholders, but where a foreigner is appointed as an authorised director holding binding signatory authority. This expansion is particularly significant because it captures structures deliberately designed to avoid foreign shareholding whilst maintaining foreign operational control through directorship powers.

**The inclusion of foreign authorised signatories** signals a fundamental shift in Thailand's regulatory enforcement approach, moving from purely shareholding-based analysis toward a comprehensive assessment of foreign involvement and influence over corporate affairs.

## The 3-Month Bank Statement Requirement

**The core mechanism of Order 2/2568 requires each Thai shareholder to demonstrate genuine financial capacity** through detailed banking documentation rather than summary certificates.

### What evidence must Thai shareholders provide?

**Thai shareholders must submit personal bank statements spanning at least three months** prior to the date of share subscription payment. These statements must come from the account actually used for the share payment and must demonstrate a withdrawal or transfer matching the exact amount and date of the payment.

**This requirement targets the practice of temporary capital staging**, where funds are deposited briefly into a Thai nominee's account to satisfy registration requirements before being withdrawn. By requiring three months of transaction history, the **DBD is verifying that investment capital is "seasoned",** genuinely belonging to the shareholder rather than representing a pass-through transaction orchestrated by a foreign principal.

**The practical impact on nominee formations is severe.** Thai nationals acting as passive nominees, typically individuals without genuine capital resources, now face a documentary burden they cannot meet without exposing the underlying nominee structure. The requirement creates an auditable trail that DBD registrars can assess for consistency and legitimacy. Separately, the same changes in registration rules by default, retrospectively lock in nominees that are on the share register of existing companies, whereby any transfer of shares or sale of the Company is subject to the same capital requirement and proof tests.

## Broader Enforcement Context

**Order 2/2568 operates within a comprehensive enforcement framework** that extends far beyond the registration gateway. Understanding the order in isolation understates its significance; it functions as one component in a coordinated, technology-driven detection system.

### How does this order connect to wider enforcement?

**The DBD Biz Regist platform** now maintains a centralised digital footprint for every registered company; shareholders, directors, and registered capital, which is cross-verified with Revenue Department tax filings in real time. **AI pattern recognition algorithms** flag high-risk indicators, including the same passive Thai shareholders appearing across multiple companies, tax filing mismatches, and disguised management fee structures.

**Companies flagged at registration feed directly into the broader enforcement pipeline.** With **852 companies prosecuted** during 2025–2026 and an estimated **THB 15.1 billion** in identified economic damages, the consequences of triggering DBD scrutiny now extend to criminal prosecution under AMLA provisions, asset seizure without court order, and company dissolution.

**Additional companion orders further tighten the registration environment.** Order 5/2568 requires welfare card holders appearing as shareholders or directors to present in person before the registrar with matching bank statements, directly targeting the use of financially incapable individuals as front shareholders. Separate address verification orders now link corporate registered offices to national civil data, preventing anonymous or unverified registrations.

## Better-than-Freehold™ Solution

**Better-than-Freehold™ eliminates the regulatory exposure created by Order 2/2568** because the structure requires no nominee company formation, no Thai shareholder capital verification, and no foreign director signatory arrangements that trigger DBD scrutiny.

### How does the BtF structure avoid these constraints?

**Thailand Investor Network** operates as a genuinely independent Thai entity without foreign funding or control, satisfying all registration and operational requirements through legitimate Thai ownership and capitalisation. No foreign investor capital flows through Thai shareholder accounts.

**SPH Trustees** functions as a regulated Labuan trust company holding lease rights and options on behalf of foreign investors, creating **registered security interests** through Land Office documentation rather than corporate shareholding structures.

**Clear Blue Security Agents** registers all contracts with Thai authorities and provides independent enforcement without court dependency, ensuring compliance throughout the investment lifecycle.

**Offshore financing** through **Siam Venture Capital** enables up to **50% loan-to-value** lending secured by trust assets, providing capital access that nominee structures never offered and that Order 2/2568 makes increasingly difficult to arrange through conventional company formations.

## Expert Recommendations

**DBD Order 2/2568 represents a permanent structural change** in Thailand's corporate registration environment, not a temporary enforcement measure. The evidentiary standards introduced by this order create lasting documentary requirements that fundamentally alter the viability of nominee company formations.

### Professional Guidance Essential

**Foreign investors currently holding property through nominee companies** should seek immediate professional assessment of their compliance position. The tightening registration environment signals continued escalation of enforcement across all aspects of corporate structuring, from initial formation through ongoing operation and eventual dissolution.

### Immediate Action Required

**The combination of registration-stage verification, AI-driven screening, inter-agency coordination, and AMLA criminal liability** creates an enforcement environment where non-compliant structures face detection from multiple directions simultaneously. With **29,000+ legal cases** initiated and enforcement expanding province by province, the window for voluntary restructuring is narrowing.
