## Quick Definition

**Better-than-Freehold™** is a legally compliant structure enabling foreign property investment in Thailand through registered lease agreements and regulated offshore beneficial ownership rights. The structure eliminates nominee company risks whilst providing enforceable property rights and access to finance in full compliance with Thai property law.

---

## How It Works

**Better-than-Freehold™** operates through four commercially contracted entities, ensuring compliance whilst delivering ownership rights benefits:

### What is Thailand Investor Network's Role?

**Thailand Investor Network (TIN)** holds the legal title as a genuinely independent Thai company without foreign funding or control. This eliminates all nominee classification indicators under current enforcement standards.

### How Does Siam Property Holdings Function?

**Siam Property Holdings (SPH)** functions as a regulated Labuan trust company holding lease rights and options on behalf of foreign investors. The trust structure provides beneficial ownership rights whilst maintaining regulatory compliance.

### What Does Clear Blue Security Agents Provide?

**Clear Blue Security Agents (CBSA)** registers all contracts with Thai authorities and provides independent mediation and enforcement of TIN and SPH contractual obligations without court dependency. This ensures rapid remedies to protect foreign investors' interests through registered security.

### How Does Financing Work?

**Siam Venture Capital (SVC)** provides offshore financing up to 50% loan-to-value secured by trust assets. This enables leverage unavailable through traditional leasehold or nominee arrangements.
Foreign investors become beneficial owners of trust assets, obtaining broad property rights through registered contracts rather than prohibited ownership structures.

## Legal Compliance

### Thai Property Law Framework

The structure operates within established Thai legal boundaries, ensuring complete compliance:
**Land Code Compliance:** TIN holds title as a legitimate Thai entity without foreign funding, eliminating nominee classification under which enforcement agencies are currently targeting tens of thousands of cases.
**Foreign Business Act Adherence:** No foreign shareholding, funding, or control indicators exist. The structure avoids all red flags identified by current prosecution patterns.
**AMLA Requirements:** Beneficial ownership operates through regulated offshore entities without concealment. Enhanced transparency meets current standards whilst preparing for Cabinet-approved amendments.
**Revenue Code Adherence:** All transactions occur at market pricing with tax declarations and payments made at prescribed rates, avoiding evasion indicators.

## Key Benefits

### Financing Access

Trust assets enable **offshore financing up to 50% LTV** through regulated credit providers. International lenders recognise beneficial interests as legitimate collateral.

### Tax Efficiency
